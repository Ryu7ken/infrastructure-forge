# Connecting to Terratowns

We will do some necessary changes in our infra code to connect our Terrahome to Terratowns.

- Provide the Terratowns Cloud URL in the `terratowns_endpoint`.
- Provide the testing town name called `missingo` to test our connection.
- Remove the hard coded value of User UUID.
- Pass the Terratowns Access Code as a variable.
- Created Web Page for our Terrahome.
