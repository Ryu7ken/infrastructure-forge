# Terratowns Mock Web Server

Andrew used Ruby Sinatra Web Server to create the Mock Server, but I do not know Ruby, so I used Gemini CLI to convert the Ruby code into Python Flask equivalent code.

## Running the Web Server

We can run the server with the command

```python
python server.py
```

All our code is stored in the `server.py` file.

## CRUD Operation Scripts

All the scrpits to perform CRUD Operations are present in the `bin/terratowns` directory.
