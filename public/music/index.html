            <img src="assets/danger.png" alt="Danger" />
            <p>Danger, whose real name is Franck Rivoire (born March 21, 1984), is a French electronic musician hailing from Lyon. He creates a unique blend of electronic, trip hop, electro house, synthwave, French house, and even witch house genres.</p>
            <p>Having started around 2007, he began releasing dated-title EPs (like 09/14 2007) on Ekler'o'shock and later his self-designed label 1789. His music often features intriguing time-themed track names such as “11h30” and “88:88”, and he’s known for wearing a black mask during live performances to distinguish his stage persona from his shy off-stage self.</p>
            <p>He's also contributed game soundtracks—Haven (2020) and Windblown (released on Steam in October 2024, streaming in December 2024).</p>
