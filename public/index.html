        <h2>Getting Started: Your First Park</h2>
        <p>Your journey begins with an empty plot of land and a dream. Here's what to keep in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Don't build too much too fast. Place a few gentle rides and food stalls near the entrance to start generating income.</li>
            <li><strong>Paths are Key:</strong> Guests will only walk on paths. A good layout prevents them from getting lost and frustrated. Think about creating main thoroughfares and smaller side paths.</li>
            <li><strong>Money Matters:</strong> Keep a close eye on your finances. Take out a loan if you need to, but be mindful of the interest payments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Keeping Your Guests Happy</h2>
        <p>Happy guests spend more money. It's that simple. Here are some hints to keep them smiling:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Listen to Their Thoughts:</strong> Click on a guest to see what they're thinking. Are they hungry? Thirsty? Do they think the park is clean? Their feedback is your most valuable resource.</li>
            <li><strong>A Place for Everything:</strong> Make sure you have a good variety of food, drinks, and souvenir stalls. And don't forget restrooms!</li>
            <li><strong>Handymen are Your Best Friends:</strong> Hire handymen to keep your paths clean and your gardens watered. A beautiful park is a happy park. And a little secret: they can also mow lawns if you give them a patrol area.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advanced Tycoon Tips</h2>
        <p>Ready to take your park to the next level? Here are some hints for the aspiring tycoon:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Custom Coasters:</strong> Building your own roller coaster is the heart of the game. Pay attention to the G-forces. Too high, and your guests will be unhappy (or worse!). A good coaster has a balance of exciting drops, turns, and airtime moments.</li>
            <li><strong>Research is Power:</strong> Invest in research and development to unlock new rides, stalls, and scenery. What you choose to research first can greatly impact your park's success.</li>
            <li><strong>The Price is Right:</strong> You can set the price for everything in your park, from park entry to the cost of a burger. Finding the sweet spot is key to maximizing profits.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="scenarios">
        <h2>Conquering the Scenarios</h2>
        <p>The game's scenarios are where the real challenge lies. Each one has a specific objective. Some general advice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Read the Objective Carefully:</strong> Make sure you know what you need to achieve. Is it a certain number of guests, a specific park value, or something else?</li>
            <li><strong>Adapt to the Environment:</strong> Each scenario has a unique landscape. Use the terrain to your advantage. A coaster that goes underground can be extra exciting!</li>
            <li><strong>Patience is a Virtue:</strong> Some scenarios take time. Don't be discouraged if you're not meeting your goal right away. Keep building, keep improving, and you'll get there.</li>
        </ul>
